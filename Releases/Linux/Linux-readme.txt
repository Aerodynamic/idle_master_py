In the spirit of open source and free software there are no Linux binaries provided. Instead run the Python script directly using the command "python2 start.py".

The script needs these Python 2 packages to run:
requests
beautifulsoup4
pillow (with jpeg and tk support)

Examples for packages that meet the dependencies:
Ubuntu: python-bs4, python-requests, python-pil.imagetk
Arch Linux: python2-beautifulsoup4, python2-requests, python2-pillow, tk
